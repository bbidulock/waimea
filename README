INTRODUCTION

   The design goal for waimea is to create the most efficie-
   nt desktop  working  environment  available.  To  achieve
   this waimea is a fast and highly customizable virtual de-
   sktop  window manager.  It uses blackbox image  rendering
   engine (blackbox styles support) and can use  Xft library
   for  font  rendering (anti-aliased font support). It also
   features a very advanced configuration system  with which
   it's  possible  to make waimea behave as almost any other
   window manager.

      Virtual desktop
