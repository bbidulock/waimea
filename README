INFO

   The design goal for waimea is to create the most efficie-
   nt desktop  working  environment  available.  To  achieve
   this waimea is a fast and highly customizable virtual de-
   sktop  window manager.  It uses blackbox image  rendering
   engine (blackbox styles support) and can use  Xft library
   for  font  rendering (anti-aliased font support). It also
   features a very advanced configuration system  with which
   it's  possible  to make waimea behave as almost any other
   window manager.

   Features already included are:
      Virtual desktop
      Blackbox image rendering engine (blackbox style support)
      Translucent textures using Xrender extension
      Action Configuration System
      Advanced Menu System
      Standard X core fonts
      Xft fonts (anti-aliased fonts)
      Dockapp handler system
      Task switcher
      Pixmap styles
      Configurable titlebar buttons


INSTALLATION

   1. Run './configure' script. By default Waimea configures 
   to  compile  with  Xft/Xrender  support for  anti-aliased 
   fonts  if support  for it  could be  found  (Need Xfree86 
   4.0.3  or  later).  If  you  don't  want  Xft  fonts  use 
   '--disable-xft' switch when running configure script. For
   a list of all available  configure  script  options  type 
   './configure --help'.

   2. Run 'make'. Should compile without errors.

   3. Run 'make install' to install binary and data files.
	
   That should be it,  Waimea  installs itself in /usr/local 
   as default.

CONFIGURATION

   You can run Waimea without doing any of these configurat-
   ion steps but you are then stuck with the default config-
   uration  options. If  you  wish to  have  your  own  user 
   configuration, do the following steps. 

   Create a '.waimea' directory structure in your home dire-
   ctory.
   mkdir ~/.waimea
   mkdir ~/.waimea/actions
   mkdir ~/.waimea/styles

   Copy default data files into directory structure.
   cp WAIMEA_DATA_INSTALL_DIR/menu ~/.waimea/menu
   cp WAIMEA_DATA_INSTALL_DIR/actions/* ~/.waimea/actions/
   cp WAIMEA_DATA_INSTALL_DIR/styles/* ~/.waimea/styles/

   Copy  the example  configuration file  to  '.waimearc' in 
   your homedir.
   cp WAIMEA_DATA_INSTALL_DIR/config ~/.waimearc

   Edit '.waimearc'. 
   Set the styleFile option  to the full  path of the  style 
   you wish to use, 'HOME_DIR/.waimea/styles/Default' to use
   default style. Set the  menuFile  option to the full path 
   of the menu file, 'HOME_DIR/.waimea/menu' if you followed 
   the instructions above.  Set the actionFile option to the 
   full path of the action file you wish to use. At the  top 
   of the action  files there's a  description  for how they 
   work, read the descriptions and decide which action  file 
   you wish to use.  'HOME_DIR/.waimea/actions.sloppy-focus' 
   to use default sloppy-focus action.

   'HOME_DIR'  must be the full path to your home  directory 
   '~' doesn't work.

   For info on how to edit the action, menu and style  files 
   see waimea(1) manual page.

RUNNING

   This can be different from system to system but the foll-
   oing should work on most systems. 

   If you're running xdm, modify the '~.xsession' by  adding
   'exec waimea' as the last executed command of the script.

   If you use startx script to start X, modify the '~.xinit-
   rx' by adding 'exec waimea' as the last executed  command 
   of the script.
