INTRODUCTION

   The design goal for waimea is to create the most efficient
   desktop  working  environment  available.  To achieve this
   waimea is a fast and highly customizable virtual  multiple
   desktop  window  manager.   It  has  a very advanced style
   engine with features like blackbox style  support,  pixmap
   style  support  and transparent textures. Text can be ren­
   dered double buffered using both  X  core  fonts  and  Xft
   fonts.   Waimea also includes a fast lightweight menu sys­
   tem with dynamic menus support.  The built in action  con­
   figuration  system makes waimea the most configurable win­
   dow manager available. It allows the user to set up waimea
   to behave as any other window manager or in new ways never
   before possible.
